To install aplplot, it's necessary to have a copy of the GNU APL source code 
installed at least for the duration of the installation of aplplot.  The GNU 
APL source can be discarded after aplwrap is installed.  The configure step 
below must be specified with something like:

./configure --with-apl-source-dir=/mnt/disk5/home/moller/tinkering/aplplot/apl-1.3

aplwrap requires GTK+ version 3.0.12 or newer, including the development
package (like gtk3-devel) if your distribution separates that from the GTK+
library package.

Once the above is in place:

	./configure --with-apl-source-dir=<GNU APL source directory>
	make
	sudo make install


You can test the installation with the following:

  1. start APL

  2. )load plotsincos

  3. plotsincos

  4. plotcomplex
