aplplot
=======

A GNU APL extension that provides plotting capability


Build and installation:

  1. git clone https://github.com/ChrisMoller/aplplot.git

  2. cd aplplot

  3. edit configure.ac to set APL_SOURCES=-I../../../../apl-1.3/src/native 
	to the right place

  4. ./autogen.sh

  5. make

  6. sudo make install


Testing/demos

  1. start APL

  2. )load plotsincos

  3. plotsincos

  4. plotcomplex



Example usage

	 'libaplplot.so' quad-FX  'plot'

	   plot a

	Where a is:

		1. A simple numeric vector, yielding a simple x-origin-0 graph
			of those values.

		2. An n-by-2 numeric array, yielding an XY plot of those values.

		3. A vector of complex values, yielding a 3-space plot.

		Other capabilities will be added as time goes on.



	  'options' plot a

	Like above but with a semicolon list of options to control the plot.
	At the moment, these options are supported:

		* 'width <value>' where <value> is an interger plot width.
		       If the argument is omitted, the option is ignored.

		* 'height <value>' where <value> is an interger plot height.
		       If the argument is omitted, the option is ignored.

		* 'dims <width> <height' combining the above into one
		    	operation.  If either argument is omitted, the option
			is ignored.

		* 'xlabel <x-axis label>' where <> is a string to use as the 
			x-axis label.  Enclosed in double-quotes ("") if the 
			string contains spaces.  If the argument is omitted,
			the label is cleared.

		* 'ylabel <x-axis label>' y-axis label.

		* 'tlabel <x-axis label>' top label.

		* 'kill' The plot function returns the process ID (pid) of
		         the process used to display the plot.  Given a right
		 	 argument of those pids, the function kills those
			 processes and closes the display windows.

		* 'xlog <state>'  If the <state> is "on" or omitted, make
		        the x-axis logarithmic.  If the state is "off," make
			the x axis linear.  "logx" is a synonym for "xlog."

		* 'ylog <state>'  See the xlog option.

		* 'xcol <column>'  Given a multi-column right argument, sets
			which column to use as the x values.  If set to -1 or
			if the argument is omitted, an x-axis is synthesized.

		* 'file <filename>'  Specifies a file name for output
		  	destinations.

		* 'dest <dest>'  Specifies an output format and must be one of
		  	screen, png, pdf, svg, eps, or ps.

		Other options will be added as time goes on.

		All options except "kill" are retained and need not be set for
		subsequent plots. 'options' plot '' can be used to store
		options without creating a plot.


	The plot function spawns and detaches processes to display the plots;
	as many plots as you like can be displayed simultaneously.  At present,
	the displays are created using the ImageMagick 'display' utility;
	right-clicking in the window brings up a menu that provides a number
	of capabilities, including that of saving the image in a variety of
	formats.  (Future enhancements of the function will likely include an
	ability to save the plots in scalable, publishable, formats.)
