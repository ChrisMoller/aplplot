For a little fun and games, you can use aplplot to create videos; in this
directory are three videos, an avi, an mkv, and a gif, made from the same
seguence of frames--compile animate.c and run mkvid to see how it works.


Note that I tried this using both bash and perl, but both get confused by the
--LX so, in frustration, I wrote the driver in C.  If anyone can fix the bash
or perl versions, I'd appreciate if you'd let me know how.
